Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher with the Overturning in the Sub-Polar North Atlantic Programme (OSNAP), and I am based at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science, which is part of the University of Miami. I am investigating the transport of Overflow Waters: deep, dense waters that originate in the Nordic Seas and spill over the Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Ridge into the Iceland Basin and Irminger Sea.

I completed my PhD at the University of Southampton, I reconstructed the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) at 26Â°N from 1981 using historical hydrographic data and a statistical regression model.
