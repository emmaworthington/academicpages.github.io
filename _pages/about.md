Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher with the Overturning in the Sub-Polar North Atlantic Programme (OSNAP), and I am based at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science, which is part of the University of Miami. 

I am investigating the transport of Overflow Waters: deep, dense waters that originate in the Nordic Seas and spill over the Denmark Strait and Iceland-Scotland Ridge into the Iceland Basin and Irminger Sea. These mix with overlying waters and eventually form the deepest part of the southwards-flowing lower limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). I'm also interested in pathways of dense Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water out of the Iceland Basin.

I completed my PhD at the University of Southampton, during which I [reconstructed the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) at 26Â°N.](/research/)
